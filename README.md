# egg-timer-in-golang
This project is simply for me learning golang, as well trying out [Gio](https://gioui.org/) as a framework to build apps with a GUI. Note that this project was followed along with the help of [@jonegil](https://github.com/jonegil) tutorial on how to build an egg timer with the help of Gio. Thanks Jon!
